# AWS ELB?

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. 

## Benifits of ELB?
1. A load balancer distributes workloads across multiple compute resources, such as virtual servers. Using a load balancer increases the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.
   
2. You can add and remove compute resources from your load balancer as your needs change, without disrupting the overall flow of requests to your applications.
   
3. You can configure health checks, which monitor the health of the compute resources, so that the load balancer sends requests only to the healthy ones. 

## Types of ELB?
+ Application Load Balancers
+ Network Load Balancers
+ Gateway Load Balancers 
+ Classic Load Balancers. 

## Regions & Availability Zones?
RegionÂ is a separate geographic area.

Availability Zones are multiple, isolated locations within each Region.

## How ELB Works?
+ A load balancer accepts incoming traffic from clients and routes requests to its registered targets (such as EC2 instances) in one or more Availability Zones.
+ The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets.
+ When the load balancer detects an unhealthy target, it stops routing traffic to that target.
+ It then resumes routing traffic to that target when it detects that the target is healthy again.

## Listeners?
A listener is a process that checks for connection requests. It is configured with a protocol and port number for       connections from clients to the load balancer.You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners.
