# AWS CodeBuild

<img src="">

+ AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud.

+ CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy.

+ CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers.

+ It provides prepackaged build environments for popular programming languages and build tools such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more.

+ You can also customize build environments in CodeBuild to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests.

## Benefits

1. **Fully managed** – CodeBuild eliminates the need to set up, patch, update, and manage your own build servers.

2. **On demand** – CodeBuild scales on demand to meet your build needs. You pay only for the number of build minutes you consume.

3. **Out of the box** – CodeBuild provides preconfigured build environments for the most popular programming languages. All you need to do is point to your build script to start your first build.

## CodeBuild Workflow

+ You can use the AWS CodeBuild or AWS CodePipeline console to run CodeBuild.

+ You can also automate the running of CodeBuild by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or the AWS SDKs.
